# YASMBC

> *Yet Another Super Meat Boy Clone*

## Introduction

**Yet Another Super Meat Boy Clone** (shortened as **YASMBC** for the remainder of this file) is a game made in 38 hours for EPITA's *Rush C* project. As the name indicates, it is a platforming game inspired by *Super Meat Boy* by Team Meat and as such, features similar gameplay mechanics (such as wall jumps for example).

## Build

### Requirements

- gcc
- SDL2 (`sdl2, sdl2_image, sdl2_mixer`)

### Instructions

After cloning the repository, run the following command in the repository's root:
```make
make
```
A binary called `main` should be created at the root of the repository.

## Usage

Run `./main` to launch the game.

### Controls

- `LeftArrow`: Move left
- `RightArrow`: Move right
- `UpArrow` or `Space`: Jump
- `Shift`: Sprint
- `P`: Pause the game
- `R`: Restart the current level
- `Escape`: Quit the game

After finishing a level (when the fanfare plays), press `Enter` to go to the next one.

### Map format

Map files follow the specification described below:
```
[Width of the map]
[Height of the map]
[Starting point X]
[Starting point Y]
[Map description (see below)]
[Number of enemies]
[Enemies description (see below)]
```
- Map description is the section that describes the blocks in the map. This section should have `height` lines and each line should have `width` columns. Each character corresponds to one block in the map and the following characters can be used:
    - `.`: void (air)
    - `#`: block
    - `$`: ice block (you cannot perform a wall jump on them)
    - `S`: stone
    - `R`: rock
    - `L`: mossy rock
    - `F`: finish block
  
  Please note that blocks, stones, rocks and mossy rocks have the exact same behaviour.
- Enemy description should follow the following format:
  ```
  {
      [Enemy ID] (always 1)
      [Position X]
      [Position Y]
      [Size W]
      [Size H]
      [Speed X]
      [Speed Y]
  }
  ``` 
  The indentation should be 4 spaces. There must be as many enemy descriptions as the number of enemies declared.
