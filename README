> *Yet Another Super Meat Boy Clone*

## Introduction

**Yet Another Super Meat Boy Clone** (shortened as **YASMBC** for the remainder of this file) is a game made in 38 hours for EPITA's *Rush C* project. As the name indicates, it is a platforming game inspired by *Super Meat Boy* by Team Meat and as such, features similar gameplay mechanics (such as wall jumps for example).

## Build

### Requirements

- gcc
- SDL2 (`sdl2, sdl2_image, sdl2_mixer`)

### Instructions

After cloning the repository, run the following command in the repository's root:
```make
make
```
A binary called `main` should be created at the root of the repository.

## Usage

Run `./main` to launch the game.

### Controls

- `LeftArrow`: Move left
- `RightArrow`: Move right
- `UpArrow` or `Space`: Jump
- `Shift`: Sprint
- `P`: Pause the game
- `R`: Restart the current level
- `Escape`: Quit the game

### Map format

Map files follow the specification described below:
```
[Width of the map]
[Height of the map]
[Starting point X]
[Starting point Y]
[Map description (see below)]
[Number of enemies]
[Enemies description (see below)]
```
- Map description is the section that describes the blocks in the map. This section should have `height` lines and each line should have `width` columns. Each character corresponds to one block in the map and the following characters can be used:
    - `.`: void (air)
    - `#`: block
    - `$`: non-"wallable" block (you cannot perform a wall jump on them)
