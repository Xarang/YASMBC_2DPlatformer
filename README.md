This is a C Video Game Project done in 38 hours straigth using SDL2 as graphical library.

The game itself is a 2D platformer emulating the game Super Meat Boy by Meat Team. The controls and features are explicited in README.

As of today the game contains some POSIX functions and is as a result not Windows-compatible. Sorry about that.
